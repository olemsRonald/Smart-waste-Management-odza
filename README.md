A cloud and WAN-based system for improving waste collection efficiency in Odza Borne 10 community
Title:
Smart Waste Management Cloud System for Odza Borne 10 Community

Description:
The Smart Waste Management Cloud System for Odza Borne 10 is a modern solution designed to improve the collection, monitoring, and management of household and public waste using cloud computing and wide area network (WAN) technologies.
The system aims to solve the persistent problem of irregular waste collection, overflowing bins, and poor communication between waste management teams in the Odza Borne 10 community of Yaound√©.

By combining IoT sensors, cloud storage, and real-time dashboards, this system allows local authorities and sanitation workers to know exactly when and where waste bins are full. The cloud server processes data sent by smart bins, and the WAN network connects all departments, ensuring better coordination and faster response.

This project demonstrates how digital technologies can improve community hygiene, reduce environmental pollution, and create a cleaner and healthier living environment for the people of Odza.

üèôÔ∏è 2. Community Background and Problem Statement

Community Overview:
Borne 10 Odza is a growing residential area located in Yaound√©, Cameroon. The population has increased rapidly in recent years, with many new houses, shops, and small businesses being built. Despite this growth, waste management remains a major problem. Most waste is collected manually, and many households lack proper bins or disposal systems. The streets are often littered with plastic, food waste, and other materials, especially after weekends or market days.

The Problem:
The main issue in Borne 10 Odza is irregular and inefficient waste collection. Trucks often come late or not at all, and residents have no way to report full or overflowing bins. Sometimes, waste is burned in open spaces, causing air pollution and health problems. During the rainy season, garbage blocks water drainage, leading to floods and bad smells.

Why It‚Äôs a Serious Issue:

It affects public health, especially children who play near waste.

It creates environmental pollution and increases mosquito-borne diseases.

It gives a bad image of the neighborhood and discourages visitors and investors.

The local council spends more money cleaning areas that could have been managed easily with a better system.


Conclusion of the Problem:
Without a smart and connected system, it‚Äôs difficult to know where waste bins are full, when to collect them, or how to plan efficient routes for garbage trucks. That‚Äôs why we propose a Smart Waste Management Cloud System for Borne 10 Odza ‚Äî to bring technology closer to the people and make the community cleaner and healthier.
