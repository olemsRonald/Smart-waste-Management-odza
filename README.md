# Smart-waste-Management-odza
A cloud and WAN-based system for improving waste collection efficiency in Odza Borne 10 community
Title:
Smart Waste Management Cloud System for Odza Borne 10 Community

Description:
The Smart Waste Management Cloud System for Odza Borne 10 is a modern solution designed to improve the collection, monitoring, and management of household and public waste using cloud computing and wide area network (WAN) technologies.
The system aims to solve the persistent problem of irregular waste collection, overflowing bins, and poor communication between waste management teams in the Odza Borne 10 community of Yaound√©.

By combining IoT sensors, cloud storage, and real-time dashboards, this system allows local authorities and sanitation workers to know exactly when and where waste bins are full. The cloud server processes data sent by smart bins, and the WAN network connects all departments, ensuring better coordination and faster response.

This project demonstrates how digital technologies can improve community hygiene, reduce environmental pollution, and create a cleaner and healthier living environment for the people of Odza.
