This project demonstrates how digital technologies can improve community hygiene, reduce environmental pollution, and create a cleaner and healthier living environment for the people of Odza.

2. Community Background and Problem Statement

Community Overview:
Borne 10 Odza is a growing residential area located in Yaound√©, Cameroon. The population has increased rapidly in recent years, with many new houses, shops, and small businesses being built. Despite this growth, waste management remains a major problem. Most waste is collected manually, and many households lack proper bins or disposal systems. The streets are often littered with plastic, food waste, and other materials, especially after weekends or market days.

The Problem:
The main issue in Borne 10 Odza is irregular and inefficient waste collection. Trucks often come late or not at all, and residents have no way to report full or overflowing bins. Sometimes, waste is burned in open spaces, causing air pollution and health problems. During the rainy season, garbage blocks water drainage, leading to floods and bad smells.

Why It‚Äôs a Serious Issue:

It affects public health, especially children who play near waste.

It creates environmental pollution and increases mosquito-borne diseases.

It gives a bad image of the neighborhood and discourages visitors and investors.

The local council spends more money cleaning areas that could have been managed easily with a better system.


Conclusion of the Problem:
Without a smart and connected system, it‚Äôs difficult to know where waste bins are full, when to collect them, or how to plan efficient routes for garbage trucks. That‚Äôs why we propose a Smart Waste Management Cloud System for Borne 10 Odza ‚Äî to bring technology closer to the people and make the community cleaner and healthier.

 3. Understanding Cloud Services

What are Cloud Services?
Cloud services are online platforms that allow people or companies to store, manage, and process data through the internet instead of using local computers. Instead of buying expensive servers or hard drives, users can use cloud platforms to access applications, files, and databases anytime and anywhere.

In simple words, the cloud is like a virtual computer on the internet ‚Äî it keeps your data safe, allows many people to connect, and provides software tools without installing anything.

Examples of Cloud Services in Real Life:

1. Google Drive ‚Äì lets you save and share documents online.


2. Dropbox ‚Äì helps businesses store and share large files easily.


3. Microsoft OneDrive ‚Äì allows users to back up files and access them from any device.


4. Amazon Web Services (AWS) ‚Äì provides powerful cloud storage, databases, and computing resources for companies.


5. Google Cloud & Microsoft Azure ‚Äì allow developers to host web applications and manage big data.



How Cloud Services are Changing Our Lives:

Students can now study online and store assignments on Google Drive.

Businesses use cloud systems to manage sales, employees, and data remotely.

Governments and hospitals use the cloud to keep citizen or patient information secure.

People can access information from their phones at any time ‚Äî no need to carry USBs or hard drives.


Why Use Cloud Services for Our Project:
In the Smart Waste Management project for Borne 10 Odza, the cloud will store all the waste bin data collected from different areas. Each smart bin can send information (like how full it is) to the cloud database in real time.
From there, local authorities or truck drivers can log in from their phones or computers to see:

Which bins are full

The best route to collect them

Reports and statistics for better planning


This helps the community reduce waste overflow and manage collection schedules more efficiently.

4. Proposed Solution Design

Overview

The Smart Waste Management System for Borne 10 Odza is a digital solution that uses cloud computing and wide area network (WAN) technologies to improve how waste is collected and managed in the community.

The idea is to install smart waste bins equipped with sensors that detect the waste level in real time. These sensors send data through the internet (WAN) to a cloud server. From there, the data can be accessed by the local waste management office, truck drivers, and community administrators using web or mobile applications.

This system allows better decision-making ‚Äî for example, trucks can go only to the bins that are full instead of wasting fuel checking all areas.

Key Users

1. Residents of Odza:

Throw waste into smart bins.

Can report broken or overflowing bins using a mobile app.



2. Waste Collection Workers (Truck Drivers):

Receive real-time alerts of full bins.

Use optimized routes suggested by the system to collect waste efficiently.



3. Municipal Council / Admins:

Monitor all waste bins on a dashboard.

Generate reports on waste levels and collection frequency.

Cloud Architecture

The system uses cloud computing to manage and store data.

Cloud Database: Stores information about each bin (ID, location, fill level, status).

Cloud Application Server: Hosts the web and mobile apps used by admins and truck drivers.

Cloud Storage: Keeps backup data and analytics reports.


We can use platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Microsoft Azure for hosting.

 WAN Connectivity

A Wide Area Network (WAN) connects all smart bins, users, and the cloud platform through the internet.

Each bin has an IoT sensor connected to a small SIM module or Wi-Fi link.

Data travels from Odza to the central cloud server via the WAN.

Users (admins, drivers) can access the system from anywhere using their phones or computers.


This ensures real-time communication, even if users are in different parts of the city.
